And i mean it when i say `without libraries and Scratch`

How ? Isn't there a complicated math involved in the Neural network (AI👨‍🎤) ?

First it's so easy that `Even your toaster could become an AI with this python code`

I know you probably heard it literally thousand times by now 

But trust me!!!

It's the last tutorial you have to read for understanding behind the scene inside the AI/Neural Network.

**Just Click SimpleEnough.ipynb once your Inside the notebook(program) click `open in colab` which will directly takes you to the code editor**
